			<h2>I found out that we have an assignment assigned to us at Feb 18. I was pretty exited to know that I had an assignment to develop a website.  When I started developing website I started with contact because I found out it easy and I was able make it pretty soon. After making contact page I started with home page, it was pretty tough to make and I wasn’t able make it in one go so I have to research quite a lot which quite got on my nerve and I continued next day. After long research and works I was finally able to make my home page and I added my picture as a background image because I thought it would be pretty unique.</h2>

			<h2>After completion of home page, I started developing portfolio page. Since, I made home page recently and learned about grid layout recently I made portfolio page without much difficulty. Then I made blog page which was also easy work than other pages and writing blog took quite a long time. Finally, it was time to develop site report page and it was also pretty easy to make however writing site report was quite a work. Making page responsive was quite a task and it was difficult. At last, I made the video demonstration where I was quite nervous.</h2>

		<h2>Finally, I was able to complete my website. It took quite a lot of time to be completed. There were times where I was quite excited and motivated and there were also times where I was little bit nervous and demotivated because CSS codes didn’t run smoothly as I thought. After a lot of ups and down I was able to complete my website and I am proud of myself as it is my first website that I developed and I think it turned out fine. </h2>
