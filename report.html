	<h2>About assignment:</h2>
<h3>I first developed contact page. I made it a simple one. After developing contact page, I started developing home page. even it was simple at first then I decided to take my own photograph as background as it was clicked in historical site which was pretty appealing and unique. After completion of home page i designed portfolio page including grid format which I had recently learnt in classes. I started to design my blog page and I tried out many texts color to make text visible and finally I added opacity to make it visible and easier to read. Finally, I created site report website which I was able to develop and design pretty easily because of my experience in developing past 4 webpage. However, writing the report took quite a lot of time.</h3>
